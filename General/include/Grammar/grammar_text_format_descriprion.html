<h2>
    GRAMMAR text presentation format
</h2>

Note: this is still work in progress<br>

<p>
    The first line is optional. It is line of parameters, starting with "Parameters: "<br>
    Each parameter must not have more than one entry in this line.<br>
    Following description is valid for empty(or absent) parameters line.<br><br>
    At the top of the file there's caption "Terminals(%u):", where '%u' stands for number<br>
    of terminals grammar have. This line should be followed by same amount of lines in each<br>
    is another terminal. Spaces, line foldings and '-' symbol are not allowed in terminals(and non-terminals).<br><br>
    Then there is similar section, starting with "Non-terminals(%u):" line. But every <br>
    <i>starting</i> non-terminal should be followed by "-S" without a space.<br><br>
    <b>Important:</b> names of terminals and non-terminals should not intersect<br><br>
    The last section consists of "Rules(%u):" line and same number of rules(one line = one rule)<br>
    Lets refer to both terminal and non-terminal as <i>item</i>. Then rules are described like this:<br>
    <b>item1 item2 ... itemN - itemN+1 itemN+2 ... itemN+K</b><br>
    where N is number of items in the left part of the rule and K is number of item in the right part.<br>
    <b>Important:</b> if there is only <i>epsilon(nothing)</i> in the right part, then it should be left<br>
    like this: "<b>item1 item2 ... itemN - </b>"<br><br>
    <b>Important:</b> each line should be no longer than 4096 bytes.<br>

</p>
<p>
    Parameters should be written in one line like this:
    Parameters: Name1=value Name2 Name3 Name4=value
