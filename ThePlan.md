Grammar: /*Constant after creation?*/
	Table of terminals and non-terminals (then I'm planning to use just numbers and flag is this symbol terminal, or not)
	Set of rules
	Operations:
		Go through rules
		Add rule		| This two may be should be implemented in builder
		Delete rule		| and not the class itself (or even without the delete one)

Rule: /*Constant after creation*/
	Has left and right sight. Should be inside grammar, as only numbers are stored /*Numbers are to increase compatibility with different types of symbols(which may be even more complex structures)*/
