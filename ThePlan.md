Rule: /*Constant after creation*/
	Has left and right sight. Should be inside grammar, as only numbers are stored /*Numbers are to increase compatibility with different types of symbols(which may be even more complex structures)*/

Translator:
	Should create link between numbers in rules and actual symbols(other types)
	Gets "grammar output" -> gives understandable output
